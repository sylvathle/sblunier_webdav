\section{Objectives of the mission}

In ATLAS, users can access to the datas of the GRID via a protocol that might be changed, they have to import the files they need on their computer to be able to use it. We want to use the https protocol so that the user can access to the datas directly from where they are stored. This function is already developped and should be tested.\\

The first objective is to make a routine that can be executed on the sites which will make a test on some stored datas and check if the new function is working. The routine will have to access to datas, to be able to use them like making work a standard benchmark of data analize, and give some feedback about possible implementation mistakes and the performances of the protocol. Then we should be able to improve the new funcionality.\\


%Until now, the user access to their data via Webdav, that should be changed to Rucio
